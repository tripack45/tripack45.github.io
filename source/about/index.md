Hi, welcome to Patricium. You have reached the personal blog of Yue Yao (姚越). I hope you will enjoy the posts. For my CV/Resume please refer to the "Resume" menu. Do please treat this page as an open dissussions/comment page. You can leave a message here for me. 

I name this place Patricium. It's made up from my English name Patrick and the [Latin suffix "ium"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/-ium), which basically means "a place". 

For a very long time I have tried to write something. I am no good writer, to be honest. I lead a simple and somewhat tedious life so I don't have much to blog about. But I will try to keep updating this blog around 1 post per week. I hope I can keep you all entertained. Posts will be written in English. Some posts are written in Chinese, which is my native tongue, mainly because they are about specific people/events around me.

Thanks for reading this.

Best,

Patrick

P.S. I would like to put a poem that I love here. Hope you Enjoy it as well.

{% blockquote Dylan Thomas, Do not go gentle into that good night %}
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
